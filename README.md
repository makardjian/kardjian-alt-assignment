# Cinema Center

A lightweight application that allows you to search for any movie in the world.

## Instructions for running the application

Navigate to the root of the project directory and run the following commands:

### `yarn install`

Wait for packages to be installed...

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

Once the app is running in the browser, click the Search Bar and search for movies by title. To execute a search press the 'Search' button, or push `Enter`.

## Possibilities for the Future

If I had more time, I might choose to do any of the following:
1. Implement "search-as-you-type" functionality so the user doesn't have to press Enter or click 'Search' to fetch results.
2. Implement a Grid View to allow users to view movie search results in a grid if they're using the app on a desktop device (probably wouldn't work on mobile).
3. Solicit help from a designer to improve the app's color scheme.


### Frameworks Used

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
